Student seminar WS20/21

Topic:  
Evaluation of Pattern Clustering and Relevance Ranking.

Description:  
The amount of existing time-series classification tasks increases every day, and deep learning approaches have shown impressive results among different classification tasks [1]. However, there is a limited amount of deep neural networks used in real-world problems due to the lack of their interpretability. In contrast to the image modalities, it is a very challenging task to understand if a patch covers a pattern that is relevant for the classification. Recently, the image domain introduces an automated process of concept segmentation and rating [2]. However, it is much more challenging to adapt this to the time-series domain. The goal of this project is to get insights into the relevance of these patches.

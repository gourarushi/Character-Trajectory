# pattern-relevance

**Type:**  
Student seminar WS20/21

**Topic:**  
Evaluation of Pattern Clustering and Relevance Ranking.

**Description:**  
The amount of existing time-series classification tasks increases every day, and deep learning approaches have shown impressive results among different classification tasks [1]. However, there is a limited amount of deep neural networks used in real-world problems due to the lack of their interpretability. In contrast to the image modalities, it is a very challenging task to understand if a patch covers a pattern that is relevant for the classification. Recently, the image domain introduces an automated process of concept segmentation and rating [2]. However, it is much more challenging to adapt this to the time-series domain. The goal of this project is to get insights into the relevance of these patches.

==================================================

**Instructions:**
- I will highly appreciate if you use [Boards](https://git.opendfki.de/mercier/pattern-relevance/-/boards) in the repository. Your tasks are already added to **"To Do"**.
- Before you start working on a specific task, please move it to **"Doing"**. And once a task is done, please move it to **"Closed"**.
- As soon as a task is finished, push the code to the repository with self-explanatory details in the commit. Please do **not** push work in progress to the repository.
- Do **not** push data files (i.e. dataset, embeddings, models etc.) to the repository as it is only intended for source files. When you want to share data files, use this [Cloud directory](https://cloud.dfki.de/owncloud/index.php/f/64008678)
- Document the code along with your implementation because it becomes very difficult to do it at the end.

**Dataset sources:**  
Huge Collection of time-series datasets: www.timeseriesclassification.com/  
Most famous time-series dataset archive: www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/  
Snythetic Anomaly Detection dataset: www.bit.ly/2UNk0Lo


**Suggested datasets:**  
- Character Trajectories: Back-projection is very interpretable.
- Synthetic Anomaly Dectection: Classification task is interpretable.
- FordA: Wide spread uni-variate datset.
- Electric Devices: Provides huge discrepancy between the classes.
- Daily and Sport Activites: Real-world data that is complex.
